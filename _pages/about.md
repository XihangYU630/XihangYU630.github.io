I am currently in my final year as an undergraduate student at [the University of Michigan](https://umich.edu/). I am double majoring in computer science (Honors Program) and mathematics (Control Systems track). I feel fortunate to be part of [CURLY Lab](https://curly.engin.umich.edu/) led by Prof. [Maani Ghaffari](https://robotics.umich.edu/profile/maani-ghaffari/). Additionally, I have had the opportunity to work closely with Prof. [Heng Yang](https://hankyang.seas.harvard.edu/) from [School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS)](https://seas.harvard.edu/) at [Harvard University](https://www.harvard.edu/). Under their guidance, I have been focused on state estimation, developing both [iterative](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.15140) and [optimization-based](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05184) fast implemented algorithms. 

Recently, I am completing my Honors Thesis on Language-conditioned Manipulation in [Lab for Progress](https://progress.eecs.umich.edu/) advised by Prof. [Chad Jenkins](https://ocj.name/). I spend the rest of time exploring Hybrid Model Predictive Control (MPC) after taking [Hybrid Control course](https://ece.engin.umich.edu/academics/course-information/course-descriptions/eecs-563/) taught by Prof. [Necmiye Ozay](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~necmiye/).

<strong>I am seeking admission to a PhD or Master's program with a focus on robotics and related fields.</strong>

<strong>Research interests: </strong> optimization, robot perception, vision-based control
