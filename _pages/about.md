I am currently in my senior year as an undergraduate student at [the University of Michigan](https://umich.edu/). I am double majoring in computer science and mathematics. I feel fortunate to be part of [CURLY Lab](https://curly.engin.umich.edu/) under the guidance of [Maani Ghaffari](https://robotics.umich.edu/profile/maani-ghaffari/). Additionally, I have had the opportunity to work closely with [Heng Yang](https://hankyang.seas.harvard.edu/) from [School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS)](https://seas.harvard.edu/) at [Harvard University](https://www.harvard.edu/). I also had a wonderful time in [Lab for Progress](https://progress.eecs.umich.edu/) advised by [Chad Jenkins](https://ocj.name/).

<strong>I am seeking admission to a PhD or Master's program with a focus on robotics and related fields.</strong>

<strong>Research interests: </strong> optimization, robot perception, vision-based control
