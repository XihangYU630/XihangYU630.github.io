I was an Instructional Aid for the graduate-level course NA 568/EECS 568/ROB 530 Mobile Robotics: Methods & Algorithms (Winter 2023) held at the University of Michigan, taught by [Prof. Maani Ghaffari](https://robotics.umich.edu/profile/maani-ghaffari/). Topics include filtering methods (Particle Filter/ Bayes Filter/ Kalman Filter/ Invariant Kalman Filter); stochastic representations of the environment; motion and sensor models for mobile robots; algorithms for mapping, localization; application to autonomous marine, ground, and air vehicles.
